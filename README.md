## Overview

HomeFinder v2 is an AI-powered application designed to assist emergency housing departments in site selection and resident placement for Emergency Interim Housing (EIH).  
It also serves as an informational hub for displaced individuals seeking EIH sites.  
The platform addresses gaps in data-driven tools by integrating infrastructure data and community sentiment analysis to support smarter, faster, and more equitable housing decisions.
